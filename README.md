# itemsetcopier

Simple Python API that enables you to translate online builds from popular League of Legends builds websites (such as MOBAfire, Mobalytics, OP.GG, Champion.gg, ...) into item sets
There is an algorithm for each LoL builds website which (in most of the cases) fetches the HTML source code of the corresponding build's webpage and translates it into a JSON string which can be imported into League of Legends simply by copy/pasting it
